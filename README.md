# Make a set of projective cards
This generates a set of cards that can be used in place of Dobble cards. The set is complete, so that the various theorems on projective planes hold exactly.

Note that the SVG generated is not good quality for printing through a regular package, although it does not perform too badly if printed from a browser to PDF.
